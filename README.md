## What is DerpSeek ?

Derpseek is a extension for Firefox that act as a  persistent clipboard.

This utility was design to hold LLM prompts/ruleset that you'll tend to reuse often (i.e. comment code, write a summary etc...).
 
Ahh also (as a feature) maybe your chabot page will be a lil' derpy :

For now the derped chatbots are :
